# üåü **Introduction to Generative AI with Vertex AI: Prompt Design**

## üìñ **Module Overview**
This module focuses on **prompt engineering** and **best practices** for designing effective prompts to enhance the quality of responses generated by large language models (LLMs). You will gain practical experience in crafting prompts that are:
- **Concise**  
- **Specific**  
- **Well-defined** (focusing on one task at a time)  

Additionally, the module introduces advanced techniques, such as:
- Transforming generative tasks into classification tasks.  
- Utilizing examples to improve response accuracy.  

For further exploration, consult the official documentation on prompt design.
